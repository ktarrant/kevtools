kevtools README
===============

kevtools is a collection of scripts written in Python 3.3 that I use to automate things. 
It is very much a work in progress, a couple of the scripts don't work at all or have 
become obsolete. 

These scripts support command-line arguments. You can see the usage information by
entering "python kevtools.py" into a command prompt at this directory.
