kevtools README
===============

kevtools is a collection of scripts that I use to automate things. It is very much
a work in progress, a couple of the scripts don't work at all or have become
obsolete. 

These scripts support command-line arguments. You can see the usage information by
entering "python kevtools.py" into a command prompt at this directory.
