About kevtools

These are some Python scripts I wrote to (a) get me more familiar with Python and (b) to try
to automate some things that I wanted to do. It is a work in progress, and I believe the
it-ebooks script no longer works because the website it downloaded ebooks from no longer
uses the same format.

Most of the coding I have done has been professional, and therefore I cannot share it because
it is IP protected by an NDA.
